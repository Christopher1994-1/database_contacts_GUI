# database_contacts_GUI

This is a Python tkinter GUI program that uses a local database to store contect information. Note: the GUI doesn't create the database it only adds to one that is already on the local drive.

This first image is what the GUI looks like without any data inside it.

When you select a contact and hit the edit button a new window pops up with entries with the data you selected already in those entries.
The close button is disabled, the submit button updates your changes in real time.

When you select a contact and click the delete button, that data is removed from the database and taken off the list in real time.
